# Talents

Each playable character has an unique talent.  
The talent can be useful in battles or at the end (rewards). It only applies when the character is used in the current battle.

Ideas:
- Pickpocket: golds x2 at the end of a battle
- Phoenix' son: resurrect the first dead ally automatically (useful in perma death mode)

The talent can be changed at the last stage of each branch of the talents tree.
